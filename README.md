# Regret Analysis for Minimax Adaptive Controller
This repository contains the MATLAB code for studying the regret of a minimax adaptive control algorithm. 

**Associated Paper:** Venkatraman Renganathan, Andrea Ianelli, and Anders Rantzer, `Online Learning and Regret Analysis for Minimax Adaptive Control Algorithm`, Submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Singapore, 2023.

# Dependencies
- Matlab
- Yalmip Toolbox
- MOSEK solver

# Procedure to run the code
1. Run the matlab code `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` which will load the required system and controller data and generate the desired plots.

## Variations while running `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` file
    * Set `disturbanceSelect = 1` in line `137` of `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` for simulations with Hinfinity adversarial disturbance
    * Set `disturbanceSelect = 2` in line `137` of `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` for simulations with confusing adversarial disturbance
    * Set `disturbanceSelect = 3` in line `137` of `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` for simulations with sinusoidal adversarial disturbance
    * Set `addrandomFlag = 1` in line `139` of `RegretDoubleIntegrator.m` for simulations with disturbance with randomness too.
